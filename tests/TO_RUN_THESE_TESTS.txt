cd to the directory containing the tests ...

install pip ...

	sudo apt-get install pip

	sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

run

	./initTests.sh

Then you can run the following tests

	testPlacement.sh is for checking the geometry is correct for the resulting AC3D. Placement is manually verified using fgfs from flightgear.
	buildLondon.sh converts some scenery of London, UK to AC3D files
	test_btg_to_ac3d_2.py and test_concat_ac3.py run some automated Python tests on the code. test_concat_ac3() is good for test-running overall concat_ac3.py functionality.
