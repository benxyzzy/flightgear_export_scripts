# 4) run
#	$osgviewer out.ac
# observe that pylons are displayed, but at the wrong angle to the scenery





# ==what did we do?==
# We changed the loc param of the scenery to match that of one of the pylons,
# because pylons were close enough to the scenery after editing the loc param, the pylons were displayed after modification

# ==what this tells us==
# The scenery loc param and the object loc params are 'too different' for some reason, and this needs correcting.
